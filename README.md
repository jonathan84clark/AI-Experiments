# AI-Experiments
The goal of this project is to experiment with AI-generated code, see how good it is and
to see what modifications need to be made in order for the code to work as expected.

## Asteroids  
The first experiment is building a simple asteroids game using pygame. Obviously chatGPT can't work with Unity since
it isn't capable of modifying 3D objects or interacting in a 3D environment.

## Status
This repository was started on 1/17/2025 and is currently active. I am open to input on any other project ideas.
